                  Rare Carat was born out of a painful experience of buying
                  diamonds online. So we created a kick-ass product to help users
                  search across a number of reputable sites at one go, and by
                  using advanced data science to help intelligently select the
                  best deal.

                  Seven out of eight people still buy diamonds offline. We want to
                  bring you online to help you spend less, get more, and feel more
                  confident doing so. We’re on your team. We’ve hand selected
                  vendors with stellar reputations and services to search with a
                  click.

                  It’s personal. Our recently engaged founder struggled with the
                  same issues you’re having today - spending a lot of money on
                  something he knew little about on sites he’d never heard of.

                  intelligence bots that ask questions in English, instead of
                  “Diamond-ese” to help guide new buyers in finding the right
